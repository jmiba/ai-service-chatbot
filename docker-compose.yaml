  # NOTE: autoheal requires Docker socket access to restart unhealthy containers.
  # This grants elevated privileges. Consider these alternatives for production:
  # 1. Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes with built-in health management
  # 2. Use an external monitoring tool (Uptime Kuma, Prometheus + alerting)
  # 3. Accept the risk if running on a dedicated host with trusted images only
